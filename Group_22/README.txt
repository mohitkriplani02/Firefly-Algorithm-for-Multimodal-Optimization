Paper Implemented: Firefly Algorithm(Paper ID 22)
Note
1. The PSO algorithm is an adapted and modified version of the open source library pySwarm as the paper does not detail the methods used to implement a PSO.
2. The code is divided into two files[firefly.py(Firefly Algorithm) and PSOAlgorithm.py(PSO Algorithm)]. You can run the code for corresponding algorithms.
3. The powerpoint presentation can also be found in the zip file.
